# Getting Started

These instructions describe a minimal local setup. They do not require installing heavy dependencies, but assume you have Python 3 installed.

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies (placeholder):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the toy VibeServer:
   ```bash
   python examples/simple_server.py
   ```

The example server simply echoes requests using an LLM call (not yet implemented). Future updates will include a full example and a test harness.
