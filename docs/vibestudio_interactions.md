# VibeStudio Interactions

This document describes how to use the dashboard controls. The Service Prompt panel features a dropdown labelled `prompt-chooser` populated from `/api/examples`. Selecting an example fills the Service Prompt textarea with that example's prompt, making it easy to try different setups.

Other panels continue to function as outlined in `vibestudio_design.md`: you can edit prompts, restart the server, view traffic, and run tests from the Tester panel.
