# Roadmap

This project is exploratory. The milestones below give a rough sense of priority but are expected to evolve.

1. **Minimal VibeServer prototype**
   - HTTP wrapper that forwards requests to an LLM.
   - Simple prompt to define a toy service (see [example_service.md](example_service.md)).
2. **Test harness**
   - Scripts to send requests and verify responses.
   - Baseline tests for regression.
3. **VibeStudio / mission control**
   - Web interface to interact with the VibeServer.
   - Panels for request logs, an embedded browser to see responses, and controls for running tests.
4. **Deployment tooling**
   - Scripts or container setup to host a VibeServer publicly.
5. **Research website and paper**
   - Public site showcasing the ideas.
   - Collect findings for a potential paper.
