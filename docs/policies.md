# Project Policies

These guidelines keep work focused and traceable while maintaining a fast R&D pace.

* Keep commits small and descriptive. Summaries should explain **why** the change was made.
* Update documentation whenever prompts, tests, or workflows change.
* Prefer simple solutions over heavy frameworks. Early prototypes can rely on scripts and small modules.
* Record research findings in `docs/research_notes.md` so future contributors have context.
* Agents should document any local setup steps or environment quirks in `docs/getting_started.md`.
