# VibeStudio / Mission Control Specification

VibeStudio provides a unified interface for interacting with a VibeServer during development.

## Key features

1. **Prompt panel** – displays the current server prompt and allows edits.
2. **Traffic panel** – shows incoming requests and outgoing responses in real time.
3. **Browser panel** – embedded view to interact with the VibeServer as a user would.
4. **Tester panel** – run automated tests against the VibeServer and display results.

## Implementation notes

* VibeStudio should run locally with minimal setup—ideally a simple Python or JavaScript server.
* Panels can be arranged using a lightweight web framework (for example, a single-page app served by Flask or Node/Express).
* Initial versions may rely on mock data; integration with the actual VibeServer and VibeTester will come later.
